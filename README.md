# Windows to MacOS Swap Command and Option (Win / Alt) for Remote Desktop Use

This is a simple ahk script that swaps Win/Alt on your local machine so that when using RustDesk to remote into a MacOS machine, you have the same keyboard layout.

## Usage

1. Open the [releases](./releases/latest) page
2. Download the version of the `.exe` file for your machine (probably x64).
3. Open the exe and use with RustDesk.

## Support

Currently the script just supports RustDesk, file an issue if you need something else.
