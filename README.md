# Windows to MacOS Swap Command and Option (Win / Alt) for Remote Desktop Use

This is a simple ahk script that swaps Win/Alt on your local machine so that when using RustDesk or Parsec to remote into a MacOS machine, you have the same keyboard layout.

## Usage

1. Open the [releases](https://github.com/MarvNC/win-to-mac-ahk/releases/latest) page
2. Download the version of the `.exe` file for your machine (probably x64).
3. Open the exe and use with RustDesk or Parsec.

## Support

Currently the script supports RustDesk and Parsec. File an issue if you need support for another remote desktop application.
